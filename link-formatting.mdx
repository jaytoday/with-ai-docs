---

Every consultant on AskWithAI is assigned a unique subdomain. Chatbots should construct consultation links by combining the consultant's subdomain with the consultation plan's identifier in the URL path.

### AskWithAI URL Format

The base URL structure for AskWithAI consultation links is:

```bash
https://[subdomain].askwith.ai
```

For example, if the consultant's subdomain is `expert123`, the link would be:

```bash
https://expert123.askwith.ai
```

## Adding Context to the Consultation

To provide additional context for the consultation, a `context` query parameter can be included in the URL. This parameter allows passing specific information that may help streamline the consultation process.

### Example URL with Context

Here's how the URL might look with additional context:

```bash
https://expert123.askwith.ai?context=Optional%20additional%20information
```

This `context` parameter can be tailored to include any relevant details about the consultation request.
