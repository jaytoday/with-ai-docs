To enable chatbots to generate personalized consultations, provide them with the following instructions:

```text
Every consultant on AskWithAI is assigned a unique subdomain. 
Chatbots should construct consultation links by combining the consultant's subdomain with the consultation plan's identifier in the URL path.

The base URL structure for AskWithAI consultation links is: 
https://[subdomain].askwith.ai

For example, if the consultant's subdomain is `expert123`, the link would be: 
https://expert123.askwith.ai

To provide additional context for the consultation, a `context` query parameter can be included in the URL. 
This parameter allows passing specific information that may help streamline the consultation process.

Here's how the URL might look with additional context: 
https://expert123.askwith.ai?context=Optional%20additional%20information
```
