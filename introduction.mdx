## How It Works 

Offering WithAI consultations consists of three simple steps: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a consultation plan">
   Describe what information you need the consultation customer to provide and what information you'll be able to provide in return, and a detailed structured consultation plan is auto-generated containing specific criteria for what is needed for the consultation to be successful. You can review and edit this consultation plan via the WithAI website or the API. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer your consultation">
   Each consultation plan has an associated URL that can be shared with your users. This URL accepts an optional `prompt` parameter to provide more context about the consultation. Consultations can also be initiated via the API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulate consultations">
    This step is optional, but assists with evaluating your consultation plans using auto-generated simulated consultations with a variety of mock user personas. Simulated consultations can be managed through the WithAI website or the API. 
  </Step>
</Steps>
