## Overview

[WithAI](https://www.getwith.ai) makes it easier than ever before to automate human-in-the-loop AI workflows. These workflows can be generated and run from a simple natural language prompt, in one line of code. 

Examples of use-cases for WithAI include:
- **Internal Processes**: Reconciliation and other business workflows.
- **Conversion Funnels**: A sign-up flow customized for each user.
- **Product Checkout**: A concierge purchasing experience for customers. 



## How It Works 

Utilizing WithAI workflows consists of three simple steps: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a workflow">
   Workflows can be created by passing a natural language workflow description to the "createWorkflow" API method, or using an intuitive workflower builder web app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the workflow">
    Use the "runWorkflow" method to kickstart a workflow. Every workflow consists of a combination of agent reasoning and interactions with human contacts using a variety of messaging channels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the outcome of the workflow">
    You can poll for updates or use a webhook to be notified of when a workflow has been completed, with a detailed history of the workflow's execution and outcome.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Integrate In One Step With Workflow Links

The three simple steps described above can be combined into one even more simple step. Just generate a URL and give it to your user.
